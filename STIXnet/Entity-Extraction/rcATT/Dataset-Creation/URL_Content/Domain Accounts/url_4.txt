Network User Authentication with SSSD SSSD stands for System Security Services Daemon and it¡¯s actually a collection of daemons that handle authentication, authorization, and user and group information from a variety of network sources. At its core it has support for: - Active Directory - LDAP - Kerberos SSSD provides PAM and NSS modules to integrate these remote sources into your system and allow remote users to login and be recognized as valid users, including group membership. To allow for disconnected operation, SSSD also can also cache this information, so that users can continue to login in the event of a network failure, or other problem of the same sort. This guide will focus on the most common scenarios where SSSD is deployed. References - Upstream project: https://sssd.io/
