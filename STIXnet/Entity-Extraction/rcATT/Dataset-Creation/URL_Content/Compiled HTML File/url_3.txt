The HTML Help executable program calls the HTML Help ActiveX control, which opens the help file and provides navigation and other features to the user. The program provides these features: - Topics appear in the Help Viewer. - The HTML Help ActiveX control is built into the Help Viewer so that any navigational elements (such as a table of contents, index, or full-text search) specified by the help author will be part of the compiled help file that a user sees.
