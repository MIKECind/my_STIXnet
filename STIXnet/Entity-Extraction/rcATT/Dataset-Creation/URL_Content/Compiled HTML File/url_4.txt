HTML Help ActiveX Control Overview The HTML Help ActiveX control (Hhctrl.ocx) provides a rich feature set for help systems. Key features include: an expanding table of contents, keyword search, shortcuts, and pop-up help topics. The control is one of the authoring components that ships with Microsoft HTML Help. It is also included with many third-party HTML Help authoring tools. The control provides functionality for two types of help systems: A compiled help (.chm) file The control uses both an Internet Explorer DLL (Shdocvw.dll) and the HTML Help compiler to offer a variety of features. Users view compiled help files in the Help Viewer. Compiled help files often ship with the programs that they document. Uncompiled HTML files on a Web site The control uses Microsoft Internet Explorer to provide a subset of its feature set. The features of HTML Help can be used on a Web site to present a wide variety of content, from Web-based help to a Web site focused on entertainment. Notes - The HTML Help ActiveX control is designed to work with Internet Explorer and the Shdocvw.dll component. It does not include the design-time support that is necessary to use it with development tools, such as Microsoft Visual Basic Scripting Edition and Microsoft Visual C++. - For more information about ActiveX technology, see Microsoft's Component Object Model (COM) technologies Web site.
