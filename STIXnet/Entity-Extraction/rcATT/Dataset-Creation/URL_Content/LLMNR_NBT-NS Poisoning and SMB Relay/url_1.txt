LLMNR (Link-local Multicast Name Resolution) is the successor of NetBIOS (Windows Vista and up) and is used to resolve the names of neighboring computers. This module forges LLMNR responses by listening for LLMNR requests sent to the LLMNR multicast address (224.0.0.252) and responding with a user-defined spoofed IP address. To display the available options, load the module within the Metasploit console and run the commands 'show options' or 'show advanced': Time is precious, so I don¡¯t want to do something manually that I can automate. Leveraging the Metasploit Framework when automating any task keeps us from having to re-create the wheel as we can use the existing libraries and focus our efforts where it matters. ¨C Jim O¡¯Gorman | President, Offensive Security
