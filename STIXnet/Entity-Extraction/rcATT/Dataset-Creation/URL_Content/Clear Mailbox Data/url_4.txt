Exchange Power Shell Exchange PowerShell is built on Windows PowerShell technology and provides a powerful command-line interface that enables automation of administrative tasks. The following PowerShell environments are available in Exchange: - Exchange Server PowerShell (Exchange Management Shell) - Exchange Online PowerShell - Security & Compliance PowerShell - Exchange Online Protection PowerShell Note For Exchange Online, Security & Compliance, and Exchange Online Protection, the module from the PowerShell Gallery that you use to connect is ExchangeOnlineManagement. For more information, see About the Exchange Online PowerShell module. For Exchange Server, there is no Microsoft-provided module in the PowerShell Gallery. Instead, to use PowerShell in Exchange, you have the following options: - Use the Exchange Management Shell on an Exchange server or that you've installed locally on your own computer using a Management tools only installation of Exchange server. For more information, see Install the Exchange Server Management Tools and Open the Exchange Management Shell. - Use remote PowerShell from a Windows PowerShell session. For more information, see Connect to Exchange servers using remote PowerShell. active-directory |Add-ADPermission | This cmdlet is available only in on-premises Exchange.
