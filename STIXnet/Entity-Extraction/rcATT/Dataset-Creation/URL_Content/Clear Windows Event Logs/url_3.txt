Caution Because Application, System, Security, and other non-custom logs can contain crucial information; be sure to specify a custom log before executing this example code. This example deletes the custom log myNewLog. #using <System.dll> using namespace System; using namespace System::Diagnostics; using namespace System::Threading; int main() { // Create an EventLog instance and assign its log name. EventLog^ myLog = gcnew EventLog; myLog->Log = "myNewLog"; myLog->Clear(); } using System; using System.Diagnostics; using System.Threading; class MySample{ public static void Main(){ // Create an EventLog instance and assign its log name. EventLog myLog = new EventLog(); myLog.Log = "myNewLog"; myLog.Clear(); } } Option Explicit Option Strict Imports System.Diagnostics Imports System.Threading Class MySample Public Shared Sub Main() ' Create an EventLog instance and assign its log name. Dim myLog As New EventLog() myLog.Log = "myNewLog" myLog.Clear() End Sub End Class Remarks Event logs are set with a maximum size that determines how many entries they can contain. When an event log is full, it stops recording new event information or begins to overwrite earlier entries. If event recording stops, you can use this method to clear the log of existing entries and allow it to start recording events again. You must have administrator permissions to the computer on which the log resides to clear event log entries. Clear closes the event log, releases the event handles, retrieves new read and write handles, and reopens the event log. Events received after the call to the method are not cleared along with the existing events.
