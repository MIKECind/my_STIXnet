Get-Global Address List This cmdlet is available in on-premises Exchange and in the cloud-based service. Some parameters and settings may be exclusive to one environment or the other. Use the Get-GlobalAddressList cmdlet to view a global address list (GAL) or a set of GALs. In Exchange Online, this cmdlet is available only in the Address Lists role, and by default, the role isn't assigned to any role groups. To use this cmdlet, you need to add the Address Lists role to a role group (for example, to the Organization Management role group). For more information, see Add a role to a role group. For information about the parameter sets in the Syntax section below, see Exchange cmdlet syntax. Syntax Get-Global Address List [-DefaultOnly] [-DomainController <Fqdn>] [<CommonParameters>] Get-Global Address List [[-Identity] <GlobalAddressListIdParameter>] [-DomainController <Fqdn>] [<CommonParameters>] Description The Get-GlobalAddressList cmdlet is mainly used to populate the GAL property pages in the Exchange admin center. This command doesn't provide a filtering capability. If filtering is required, you should use a WHERE clause with the command. You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet.
