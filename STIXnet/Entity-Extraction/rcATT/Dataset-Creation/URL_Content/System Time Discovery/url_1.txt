set aggressive-mode client-endpoint To specify the Tunnel-Client-Endpoint attribute within an Internet Security Association Key Management Protocol (ISAKMP) peer configuration, use the set aggressive-mode client-endpoint command in ISAKMP policy configuration mode. To remove this attribute from your configuration, use the no form of this command. set aggressive-mode client-endpoint client-endpoint no set aggressive-mode client-endpoint client-endpoint Syntax Description | client-endpoint | One of the following identification types of the initiator end of the tunnel: The ID type is translated to the corresponding ID type in Internet Key Exchange (IKE). Command Default The Tunnel-Client-Endpoint attribute is not defined.

Usage Guidelines Before you can use this command, you must enable the crypto isakmp peer command. To initiate an IKE aggressive mode negotiation and specify the RADIUS Tunnel-Client-Endpoint attribute, the set aggressive-mode client-endpoint command, along with the set aggressive-mode password command, must be configured in the ISAKMP peer policy. The Tunnel-Client-Endpoint attribute will be communicated to the server by encoding it in the appropriate IKE identity payload. Examples The following example shows how to initiate aggressive mode using RADIUS tunnel attributes: crypto isakmp peer address 10.4.4.1 set aggressive-mode client-endpoint user-fqdn user@cisco.com set aggressive-mode password cisco123
