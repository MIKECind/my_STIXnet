This post is also available in: »’±æ’Z (Japanese) Executive Summary Unit 42 recently observed a polyglot Microsoft Compiled HTML Help (CHM) file being employed in the infection process used by the information stealer IcedID. We will show how to analyze the polyglot CHM file and the final payload so you can understand how the sample evades detection. Multiple attack groups such as Starchy Taurus (aka APT41) and Evasive Serpens (formerly tracked as OilRig, also known as Europium) have abused CHM files to conceal payloads written using PowerShell or JavaScript. Here, we describe an interesting attack that allows attackers to avoid the need for long lines of code, which can make it easier for malicious files to evade detection by security products. Polyglot files can be abused by attackers to hide from anti-malware systems that rely on file format identification. The technique involves executing the same CHM file twice in the infection process. The first execution exhibits benign activities, while the second execution stealthily carries out malicious behaviors. This particular attack chain was discovered in early August 2022 and delivered IcedID, also known as Bokbot, as the final payload. This information stealer, IcedID, is well-known malware that has been attacking users since 2019. Palo Alto Networks customers receive protections from malware families using similar anti-analysis techniques with Cortex XDR or the Next-Generation Firewall with cloud-delivered security services including WildFire, Advanced Threat Prevention, Advanced URL Filtering and DNS Security. |Related Unit 42 Topics |Malware, IcedID, Evasion Table of Contents Malicious Polyglot CHM File IcedID DLL°Øs Configuration Extraction Conclusion Indicators of Compromise Malicious Polyglot CHM File Polyglot files are binaries that have multiple different file format types. The file would have a different behavior depending on the application that was used to execute it. The attack that was discovered in early August 2022 starts with a phishing email that includes an attached zip file named erosstrucking-file-08.08.2022.zip. The zip file decompresses into an ISO image file named order-130722.28554.iso. Inside the ISO file is a CHM file called pss10r.chm (SHA256: 3d279aa8f56e468a014a916362540975958b9e9172d658eb57065a8a230632fa). The polyglot CHM file is used to display help documentation. When the user launches the CHM file (pss10r.chm), a harmless help window is displayed. To dump the contents of the CHM file, we used 7zip. The file of interest is PSSXMicrosoftSupportServices_HP05221271.htm. Most of the code in the HTML file is used for generating the decoy window. However, concealed within the HTML code is a single-line command to execute the same CHM file again. The command calls Mshta.exe to execute itself (pss10r.chm) a second time. Mshta.exe is a utility that executes Microsoft HTML Application (HTA) files. HTAs are full-fledged applications created using HTML. The code of the HTA is buried within the binary of the CHM file and configured to be invisible to the victim during execution. The HTA is used to execute the binary app.dll. The binary app.dll is actually hidden within the ISO image. The hidden binary can be revealed using the attrib command. The app.dll binary is a 64-bit IcedID DLL.

The IcedID DLL°Øs configuration is encoded and stored in the data section of the binary. The encoded configuration has the format shown in Figure 6. The following function would decode the IcedID DLL°Øs configuration at runtime. The address of the encoded configuration (enc_config) is in the function. The decoded IcedID DLL°Øs configuration has the following format. From the decoded configuration, we can extract the following IoCs: |Command and Control URL |abegelkunic[.]com |Campaign ID |4157420015 Conclusion Threat actors continue to evolve their techniques to evade detection. The above analysis demonstrates how attackers abused a polyglot Microsoft Compiled HTML file to deliver an IcedID payload. It is important for defenders not to trust binaries based on their file types since polyglot files such as the one discussed here have more than one correct file type.
