This is where an attacker re-directs a victim¡¯s web traffic (perhaps by modifying DNS settings or modifying the hosts file on the victim machine) to a spoof web site. The victim believes they are connected to their bank¡¯s web site and the flow of traffic to and from the real bank site remains unchanged, so the victim sees nothing suspicious. However, the traffic is re-directed through the attacker¡¯s site, allowing the attacker to gather any personal data entered by the victim (login, password, PIN, etc.).
