This page explains how to use Cloud Monitoring to view usage metrics for your service accounts and service account keys. These metrics let you view and track usage patterns, which can help you identify anomalies, either automatically or manually. Service accounts and service account keys appear in these metrics if they are used to call any Google API, including APIs that are not part of Google Cloud. The metrics include both successful and failed API calls. For example, if an API call fails because the caller is not authorized to call that API, or because the request referred to a resource that does not exist, the service account or key that was used for that API call appears in the metrics. Service account keys also appear in these metrics if a system lists the keys while attempting to authenticate a request, even if the system doesn't use the key to authenticate the request. This behavior is most common when using signed URLs for Cloud Storage or when authenticating to third-party applications. As a result it is possible to see usage metrics for keys that have not been used for authentication. Monitoring retains service account metrics for 6 weeks. If you need to access data for a longer time period, you can periodically export the results to BigQuery. For more information, see Monitoring metric export in the Solutions documentation. After you use a service account or service account key, usage metrics are usually available within a few minutes. Before you begin - Enable the IAM and Cloud Monitoring APIs. Required roles To get the permissions that you need to view recent usage for service accounts and keys, ask your administrator to grant you the Monitoring Viewer ( roles/monitoring.viewer) IAM role on the project. For more information about granting roles, see Manage access. You might also be able to get the required permissions through custom roles or other predefined roles. View usage metrics for all service accounts or keys To view the usage metrics for your service accounts or service account keys, follow these steps: Console To use Metrics Explorer to view the metrics for a monitored resource, follow these steps: - In the Google Cloud console, select Monitoring, and then select leaderboard Metrics Explorer, or click the following button: - In the Select a metric pane, expand the Metric menu, enter IAM Service Accountin the filter bar, and then use the submenus to select a specific resource type and metric: - In the Active resources menu, select IAM Service Account. - In the Active metric categories menu, select Service_account. - In the Active metrics menu, select a service account metric. The following metrics are available within your selected time interval: - For service account usage metrics, select Service account authentication events. - For service account key usage metrics, select Service account key authentication events. - Click Apply. - Optional: To configure how the data is viewed, add filters, groupings, and configure the alignment fields. By default, Metrics Explorer adds a grouping that averages all time series: - To group time series by resource or metric labels, expand the Labels menu in the Group by section, and then make your selections. You can also change the Grouping function. - To view all time series, in the Group by entry, click deleteDelete. - To access the alignment fields, click More Options. - Optional: Change the settings in the Display pane: - For quota and other metrics that report one sample per day, set the Widget type to Stacked bar chart. - For distribution valued metrics, set the Widget type to Heatmap chart. - Optional: For quota and other metrics that report one sample per day, set the time frame to at least one week. REST The Cloud Monitoring API API's timeSeries.list method allows you to access usage metrics programmatically. Before using any of the request data, make the following replacements: PROJECT_ID: Your Google Cloud project ID. Project IDs are alphanumeric strings, like my-project. - METRIC_TYPE: The type of metric you want to check. Use one of the following values: - For service account usage metrics, use iam.googleapis.com%2Fservice_account%2Fauthn_events_count. - For service account key usage metrics, use iam.googleapis.com%2Fservice_account%2Fkey%2Fauthn_events_count. - For service account usage metrics, use END_TIME: The end of the time interval that you want to check, in percent-encoded RFC 3339 format. For example, 2020-06-12T00%3A00%3A00.00Z. START_TIME: The start of the time interval that you want to check, in percent-encoded RFC 3339 format. For example, 2020-04-12T00%3A00%3A00.00Z.
