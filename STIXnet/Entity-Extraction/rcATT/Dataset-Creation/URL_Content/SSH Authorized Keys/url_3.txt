ip source-track To enable IP source tracking for a specified host, use the ip source-track command in global configuration mode. To disable IP source tracking, use the no form of this command. ip source-track ip-address no ip source-track ip-address Syntax Description | ip-address | Destination IP address of the host that is to be tracked. Command Default IP address tracking is not enabled. Command Modes Global configuration Command History | Release | Modification | 12.0(21)S | This command was introduced. | 12.0(22)S | This command was implemented on the Cisco 7500 series routers. | 12.0(26)S | This command was implemented on Cisco 12000 series ISE line cards. | 12.3(7)T | This command was integrated into Cisco IOS Release 12.3(7)T. | 12.2(25)S | This command was integrated into Cisco IOS Release 12.2(25)S. | 12.2(33)SRA | This command was integrated into Cisco IOS release 12.(33)SRA. | 12.2SX | This command is supported in the Cisco IOS Release 12.2SX train. Support in a specific 12.2SX release of this train depends on your feature set, platform, and platform hardware. Usage Guidelines IP source tracking allows you to gather information about the traffic that is flowing to a host that is suspected of being under attack. It also allows you to easily trace a denial-of-service (DoS) attack to its entry point into the network. After you have identified the destination that is being attacked, enable tracking for the destination address on the whole router by entering the ip source-track command. Examples The following example shows how to configure IP source tracking on all line cards and port adapters in the router. In this example, each line card or port adapter collects traffic flow data to host address 100.10.0.1 for 2 minutes before creating an internal system log entry; packet and flow information recorded in the system log is exported for viewing to the route processor or switch processor every 60 seconds.
