Unrivaled ability to ingest and normalize petabytes of data from the entire IT environment. The entire picture and context of the malicious operation, not more alerts. Automatic prediction and response to defeat the attack without human intervention. We don't have to sift through data to find what we're looking for, with Cybereason our team can just focus on what's important, mitigate and isolate on the fly, and even automate those processes. I love Cybereason because it works. We believe that they're the leader in the industry in relation to our current posture. We are very satisfied with the Cybereason product, it's the best protection we're getting, and keeps us out of the news, which is the important part for us.
