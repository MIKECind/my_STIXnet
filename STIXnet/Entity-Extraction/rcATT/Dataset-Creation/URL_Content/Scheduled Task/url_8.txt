Answered by: Scheduled Tasks History Retention settings Question - Hello, I am currently only able to view the History for my Scheduled Tasks going back only 1 day on Windows Server 2012 R2. Is there a way to increase this to at least 7 days? I have noticed that on Windows Server 2008 R2 the History seems to at least go back 3 days. Any help here would be greatly appreciated! Kind regards, DanielMonday, November 2, 2015 3:03 PM Answers - Hi Daniel, I believe you need to increase the below eventlog's Properties to retain more logs. History pulls eventID 140 from here. A task's history is tracked by events in the Microsoft-Windows-TaskScheduler event log. Microsoft-Windows-TaskScheduler/Operational Set Log Retention Policy - TechNet - Microsoft - Default is 10MB of data, if you run lots of schtsk then it needs to be increased.

The current value was 1MB for my system so I have increased this to 1GB to see how many days of History this will give me. I take it there is no way to set the logs to clear after 7 days instead of having them clear based on the log file size? Kind regards, DanielTuesday, November 3, 2015 3:05 PM - Hi Daniel, The options vary log to log basis, for this one, you need to do it using size. Keep track for few weeks and you would know the exact size required to keep 7days data. Your 1MB setting would mean, someone is worried on the disk space, so be careful, you should start small, make it 100MB and see how much it retains.

The link you provided is broken.Monday, September 23, 2019 12:58 PM - In WIN10 (and Server2012) this is a property of the event log. First open the event viewer.. Applications and Services Logs/ Microsoft/ Windows / TaskScheduler There you can pick Maintenance or Operational - Properties.. Extend the size of the log file. (operational is 10MB by default)Wednesday, April 29, 2020 2:58 PM
