AWS account root user When you first create an Amazon Web Services (AWS) account, you begin with a single sign-in identity that has complete access to all AWS services and resources in the account. This identity is called the AWS account root user and is accessed by signing in with the email address and password that you used to create the account. Important We strongly recommend that you don't use the root user for your everyday tasks and that you follow the root user best practices for your AWS account. Safeguard your root user credentials and use them to perform the tasks that only the root user can perform. For the complete list of tasks that require you to sign in as the root user, see Tasks that require root user credentials. The following topics detail management tasks associated with the root user. Tasks - Enable a virtual MFA device for your AWS account root user (console) - Enable a hardware TOTP token for the AWS account root user (console) - Enable a FIDO security key for the AWS account root user (console) - Change the password for the AWS account root user - Resetting a lost or forgotten root user password - Creating access keys for the root user - Deleting access keys for the root user - Tasks that require root user credentials - Troubleshooting issues with the root user - Related information
