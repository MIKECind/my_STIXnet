HeadBucket This action is useful to determine if a bucket exists and you have permission to access it. The action returns a 200 OK if the bucket exists and you have permission to access it. If the bucket does not exist or you do not have permission to access it, the HEAD request returns a generic 400 Bad Request, 403 Forbidden or 404 Not Found code. A message body is not included, so you cannot determine the exception beyond these error codes. To use this operation, you must have permissions to perform the s3:ListBucket action. The bucket owner has this permission by default and can grant this permission to others. For more information about permissions, see Permissions Related to Bucket Subresource Operations and Managing Access Permissions to Your Amazon S3 Resources. To use this API operation against an access point, you must provide the alias of the access point in place of the bucket name or specify the access point ARN. When using the access point ARN, you must direct requests to the access point hostname. The access point hostname takes the form AccessPointName-AccountId.s3-accesspoint.Region.amazonaws.com. When using the AWS SDKs, you provide the ARN in place of the bucket name. For more information, see Using access points. To use this API operation against an Object Lambda access point, provide the alias of the Object Lambda access point in place of the bucket name. If the Object Lambda access point alias in a request is not valid, the error code InvalidAccessPointAliasError is returned. For more information about InvalidAccessPointAliasError, see List of Error Codes.
